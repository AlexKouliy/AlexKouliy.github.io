      "content": "You are holding a piece of someone's soul. It is cracked, bleeding, and unapologetically alive. May it remind you that your storms are not flaws. They are proof you've dared to feel in a world that begs you to numb. Walk the edge. Bleed. Burn. And when you rise, know that someone out there is rising with you.",

      "note": "This message appears etched into the inside cover of every book and game menu, serving as both invitation and reminder of the raw emotional truth within."
