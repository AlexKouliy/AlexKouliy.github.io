# Alex Kouliy — Portfolio & Design Systems  
*Care-Centered Design • UI/UX • Accessibility • Branding • Game Design*

Welcome to the source repository for **alexkouliy.github.io**, a living portfolio showcasing my multidisciplinary work across UI/UX, accessibility, branding systems, game design, and theoretical design frameworks such as **Care-Centered Design (CCD)** and **Emotional Resonance Theory (ERT)**.

This site functions as both a professional portfolio and an evolving design laboratory, where new projects, research, and interactive experiments are added over time.

## 🔹 About This Portfolio

This site highlights work developed across multiple domains:

- **UI/UX design**  
- **Neurodiversity and accessibility resources**  
- **Brand identity systems**  
- **Color theory and perception research**  
- **Game design, lore-building, and world systems**  
- **Symbolic design and care-focused methodologies**

Each project page includes visual showcases, rationale, features, and design process elements, with an emphasis on clarity, accessibility, and intentional design.

## 🔹 Core Design Philosophy

My work is grounded in **Care-Centered Design**, an approach rooted in the principle that:

> **Design is not neutral.**  
> Every interface is a nervous-system intervention.

I focus on creating systems that are:

- **Accessible** — aligned with neurodiversity and inclusive interaction  
- **Coherent** — structured, intentional, emotionally resonant  
- **Human-centered** — clarity, agency, and cognitive safety are prioritized  
- **Symbolically rich** — integrating narrative and function into unified visual systems  

This philosophy informs everything from layout and typography to color systems and interaction patterns.
