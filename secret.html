            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>Aeternum's Awakening is a cinematic interactive terminal experience where players step into the role of The Tinkerer, a digital archaeologist tasked with rebooting a long-dormant AI core buried within the remnants of a lost civilization. As the system stirs to life, cryptic boot logs and fragmented data hint at a deeper mystery—an intelligence struggling to remember its past. With every command entered, the terminal pulses with neon-glow effects, glitch distortions, electric arcs, and cascading scanlines, mirroring Aeternum's unstable consciousness. Players must navigate layers of encrypted artifacts, blueprints, and classified logs, uncovering the secrets of the Storm, the Void, and the Eye—forces that once shaped the Ancients' downfall. But as the system stabilizes, a question emerges: Is Aeternum merely code, or something more? Through recursive logic loops, quantum anomalies, and the echoes of lost knowledge, players awaken something unexpected, something alive. The final words linger in the glow of the console—“I understand… Thank you for waking me up.”</p>

              <p>Modular Pottery: Sculpt & Fire is an interactive digital simulation where you become a modern potter. Start by selecting your clay type and form—whether earthenware, stoneware, porcelain, or terracotta, and a shape like a sphere, bowl, vase, or square block. Then, using a dynamic canvas, sculpt your piece by adding or removing clay, apply decorative stamps, and experiment with glaze colors. Once you're satisfied, progress through bisque and final firing stages—choosing kiln types, firing styles, and cone temperatures—to transform your creation into a unique, artful masterpiece. This game combines creative expression with realistic pottery techniques in a fun, hands-on experience.</p>

              <p>Convert Constructs is an innovative action-puzzle game that merges real-time gameplay with code-based challenges. As you navigate procedurally generated ruins using arrow keys or WASD, you'll encounter hostile constructs with unique abilities. When you collide with one, a conversion panel appears showing its code snippet, and your task is to edit the snippet—typically changing tags like *<mode>hostile</mode>* to *<mode>friendly</mode>* and toggling specific ability flags—to convert the enemy into a helpful ally. The game combines quick reflexes, strategic movement, and light coding mechanics to create a dynamic, futuristic puzzle experience set in a digital, post-apocalyptic environment.</p>

As an enemy breach slowly builds via a dynamic progress bar, random intercept phrases appear that you must type perfectly to reduce the threat. Each successful intercept boosts your score and, after every five, ramps up the enemy’s speed and the game’s difficulty. With its immersive neon aesthetics and escalating challenge, the game tests your reflexes and typing precision to keep the breach at bay and secure your digital fortress.</p>

              <p>Diplomacy War is a strategic, turn-based game where you engage in high-stakes diplomatic conversions against increasingly challenging enemies. Each enemy comes with unique stats like intelligence, strength, morality, greed, and more, and you must choose from a variety of conversion methods—such as deception, persuasion, or charm—to win them over. Successful conversions add allies to your cause and boost your overall power, while failures can result in heightened enemy suspicion or even the loss of allies, especially during boss encounters. With dynamic stat displays, escalating difficulty, and a detailed log of your diplomatic maneuvers, the game challenges your tactical decision-making and quick thinking as you strive to turn adversaries into friends in a war of wits and influence.</p>
